## Matrix Anatomy

The ATT&CK Enterprise matrix is organized into *14 tactics—the high-level adversary goals—and **200+ techniques* (with 600+ sub-techniques) that describe how those goals are achieved.

| Tactic (Goal)               | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Initial Access              | How attackers enter a network or system |
| Execution                   | How adversaries run code                |
| Persistence                 | How they maintain foothold              |
| Privilege Escalation        | How they gain higher permissions        |
| Defense Evasion             | How they hide activities                |
| Credential Access           | How they steal credentials              |
| Discovery                   | How they gather information             |
| Lateral Movement            | How they move across systems            |
| Collection                  | How they gather data                    |
| Exfiltration                | How they steal data out                 |
| Command and Control         | How they communicate with C2 servers    |
| Impact                      | How they disrupt or destroy systems     |

  <h3>Techniques vs. Sub-Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    Each technique (e.g., <strong>T1059</strong>: <em>Command and Scripting Interpreter</em>) can have multiple sub-techniques (e.g., <strong>T1059.001</strong>: <em>PowerShell</em>; <strong>T1059.003</strong>: <em>Windows Command Shell</em>), allowing practitioners to document precisely which method was observed.
  </p>

  <h3>Enterprise vs. Cloud, Mobile, ICS</h3>
  <p>
    While this module focuses on the Enterprise matrix, MITRE also publishes specialized matrices:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cloud</strong>: Techniques unique to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure GCP).</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile</strong>: Android/iOS-specific tactics and techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>ICS</strong>: Operational technology and industrial control systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Building a Navigator Layer</h3>
  <p>
    ATT&CK Navigator lets you create custom layers—JSON files that color-code techniques based on detection coverage or risk priority. Basic steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the Enterprise matrix JSON from the MITRE site.</li>
    <li>Import into Navigator and assign colors (e.g., green = covered, red = gap).</li>
    <li>Export your layer to share with the team or embed on your intranet.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Forensic Coverage Mapping</h3>
  <p>
    By overlaying your SIEM/EDR rule set onto Navigator, you can visualize which techniques you detect—and where your blind spots lie. This drives prioritized rule development and log source onboarding.
