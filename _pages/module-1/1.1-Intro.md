## Overview

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is an *open, peer-reviewed knowledge base* that catalogs the full spectrum of adversary behaviors observed in real intrusions. It enables DFIR teams to:

1. *Standardize* how they describe attacker actions.  
2. *Map* forensic evidence and log artifacts directly to specific techniques.  
3. *Assess* detection and mitigation coverage across their environment.

Originally launched in 2013, ATT&CK has evolved into three primary matrices:

- *ATT&CK for Enterprise* (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- *ATT&CK for Mobile* (Android, iOS)  
- *ATT&CK for ICS* (Industrial Control Systems)  

Each matrix is organized into *tactics—the adversary’s tactical goals—and their corresponding **techniques* and *sub-techniques* that describe exactly how those goals are achieved in the wild.

## 1. History & Evolution

- *2013*: MITRE publishes the first ATT&CK draft—focused on Windows endpoint behaviors observed in advanced persistent threats (APTs).  
- *2015–2017*: Community feedback adds Mac and Linux techniques; sub-techniques introduced for finer granularity.  
- *2018*: ATT&CK for Mobile launched, capturing Android/iOS adversary methods.  
- *2020*: ATT&CK for ICS released, aligning industrial intrusion tactics to control-system environments.  
- *Ongoing: Quarterly updates add new techniques, refine sub-techniques, and publish associated **data sources* (e.g., Windows Security logs, network packets) to guide forensic collection.

ATT&CK’s open development model encourages practitioners to submit *use cases, **corrections, and **new techniques* via GitHub, ensuring the framework stays aligned with emerging threats.

## 2. Why ATT&CK for Forensics?

1. *Empirical Basis*: Techniques are grounded in documented adversary campaigns (e.g., APT28 spearphishing, FIN7 point-of-sale compromise).  
2. *Evidence-Driven*: Each technique entry lists associated data sources—enabling analysts to know exactly which logs, memory artifacts, or registry keys to collect.  
3. *Communication: Standardized IDs (e.g., **T1566* for Phishing) ensure clarity when sharing findings with SOC, threat intel, or leadership.  
4. *Gap Analysis*: By overlaying detective and preventive controls onto the matrix, teams can identify unmonitored techniques and prioritize improvements.

## 3. Core Concepts

| Term                     | Definition                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Tactic*               | The adversary’s technical goal (e.g., Execution, Persistence).                                              |
| *Technique (TID)*      | A specific action or method used to achieve a tactic (e.g., *T1059: *Command and Scripting Interpreter).   |
| *Sub-Technique (TID.###)* | Fine-grained variant of a technique (e.g., *T1059.001: *PowerShell).                                          |
| *Procedure*            | Real-world implementation of a (sub-)technique, often with code samples or tool references (e.g., Mimikatz).   |
| *Data Source*          | Log or telemetry category that can record evidence of a technique (e.g., Process command-line parameters).    |

## 4. ATT&CK Matrices

1. *Enterprise*  
   - Phases: Initial Access → Execution → … → Impact  
   - 14 Tactics, 200+ Techniques, 600+ Sub-techniques  

2. *Mobile*  
   - Specialized for Android/iOS-specific vectors (SMS phishing, mobile exploits).  

3. *ICS*  
   - Addresses OT-specific tactics (e.g., Manipulation of Control Logic, Damage to Property).

Use the *ATT&CK Navigator* to visualize and interact with these matrices—filter by platform, tactic, and technique.

## 5. Looking Ahead

In *Module 1.2* (“ATT&CK Matrix & Core Architecture”), we’ll dissect each component of the Enterprise matrix, walk through real examples of the most prevalent techniques, and learn how to build custom Navigator layers for forensic mapping and detection-gap analysis.
