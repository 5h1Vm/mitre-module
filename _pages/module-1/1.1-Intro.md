## What Is MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is an *open, community-driven knowledge base* of real-world adversary actions. It helps forensic analysts:

- *Standardize* descriptions of attacker behavior.  
- *Map* evidence (logs, memory, registry) directly to defined techniques.  
- *Identify* gaps in detection and coverage.

Initially launched in 2013 for Windows endpoint threats, ATT&CK now encompasses three matrices:

| Matrix     | Focus                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Enterprise | Windows, Linux, macOS endpoint and network   |
| Mobile     | Android & iOS devices                        |
| ICS        | Industrial control systems and OT networks   |

## How ATT&CK Evolved

1. *2013* – First Windows-focused draft based on APT research.  
2. *2015–2017* – Mac/Linux support and sub-technique granularity added.  
3. *2018* – Mobile matrix publishes Android/iOS methods.  
4. *2020* – ICS matrix arrives, covering SCADA/PLC attacks.  
5. *Ongoing* – Quarterly updates refine entries and publish data sources (Sysmon, event logs, network).

Every update is driven by real incident reporting and community feedback, ensuring the framework stays aligned with emerging threats.

## Why Forensic Analysts Rely on ATT&CK

- *Empirical Foundation:* Techniques derive from documented campaigns (e.g., APT28 spear-phishing).  
- *Evidence-Linked:* Each entry lists its *data sources* (Windows Event IDs, registry keys, network logs).  
- *Unified Vocabulary:* IDs like *T1566* (Phishing) or *T1059* (Scripting) eliminate ambiguity.  
- *Visibility Gaps:* By overlaying your logs and tools onto the matrix, you can pinpoint unmonitored attacker actions.

## Core Concepts at a Glance

| Term              | Definition                                                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Tactic*        | Adversary goal (e.g., Execution, Persistence).                                          |
| *Technique*     | Method to achieve a tactic (e.g., *T1059: *Command and Scripting Interpreter).          |
| *Sub-Technique* | More specific variant (e.g., *T1059.001: *PowerShell).                                  |
| *Procedure*     | Real-world example or tool implementing a technique (e.g., Mimikatz credential dumping).     |
| *Data Source*   | Telemetry category where evidence is found (e.g., Process Creation logs).                 |
