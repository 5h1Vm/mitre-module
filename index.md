## What is MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a curated knowledge base that documents the behavior of real-world threat actors. It is used across the cybersecurity industry to model, analyze, and detect adversarial actions throughout the attack lifecycle.

This platform provides a structured training experience that teaches participants how to:
- Understand ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Map forensic artifacts to adversary behavior
- Apply ATT&CK in SOC operations, red teaming, and detection engineering

---

## Training Methodology

Each module in this training program follows a consistent and progressive structure:

- *Theory:* Conceptual foundations with examples
- *Hands-On Labs:* Controlled, scenario-based exercises and simulations
- *Cheatsheets:* Quick-reference terminology, IDs, and correlations
- *Playbooks & Case Studies:* Real-world mappings with procedure-level insight
- *Assessment:* Lab submissions, quizzes, and detection challenges

This format is tailored for analysts, security teams, law enforcement, and students preparing for operational roles in cybersecurity and digital forensics.

## Why This Training?

- Designed to align with real-world investigations and attacker behavior
- Based on structured adversary emulation and forensic evidence analysis
- Fully modular with downloadable resources and JSON layers
- Includes mappings to NIST CSF, Kill Chain, and ISO 27001
- Enables consistent communication of TTPs across security teams
